# Spring-Sample-App

This is a quick application to manage trainings. 
Developed using spring MVC/REST/DATA/JPA modules.
Its very basic, meaning yet to implement exception handling, unit test cases, REST client (or UI)
The plan is to extend the application to 
  Allow admin to add users/suppliers
  Allow admin to manage users/suppliers and trainings. 
  Allow admin should to view/update trainings per user/supplier vice-versa
  Also allow user/supplier to login and mark trainings as complete or re-evaluate etc.
